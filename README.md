> Nuxt user authentication and sessions via [NextAuth.js](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth). `nuxt-auth` wraps [NextAuth.js](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth) to offer the reliability & convenience of a 12k star library to the nuxt 3 ecosystem with a native developer experience (DX).

## Quick Start

1. Install the package:
    ```sh
    npm i -D @sidebase/nuxt-auth
    ```
2. Add the package to your `nuxt.config.ts`:
    ```ts
    export default defineNuxtConfig({
      modules: ['@sidebase/nuxt-auth'],
      auth: {
        enableGlobalAppMiddleware: true
      }
    })
    ```
3. Create the authentication handler (`NuxtAuthHandler`) and add at least one [authentication provider](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/):
    ```ts
    // file: ~/server/api/auth/[...].ts
    import { NuxtAuthHandler } from '#auth'
    import GithubProvider from 'next-auth/providers/github'

    export default NuxtAuthHandler({
      providers: [
        // @ts-ignore Import is exported on .default during SSR, so we need to call it this way. May be fixed via Vite at some point
        GithubProvider.default({ clientId: 'your-client-id-here', clientSecret: 'your-client-secret-here' })
      ]
    })
    ```
    - `[..].ts` is a catch-all route, see the [nuxt server docs](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/directory-structure/server#catch-all-route)
4. Done! You can now use all user-related functionality, for example:
    - application-side session access:
        ```ts
        // file: ~/pages/some-page.vue
        const { status, data, signIn, signOut } = useSession()

        status.value // Session status: `unauthenticated`, `loading`, `authenticated`
        data.value // Session data, e.g., expiration, user.email, ...

        await signIn() // Sign-in the user
        await signOut() // Sign-out the user
        ```
    - application-side local page protection (i.e., when `enableGlobalAppMiddleware: true` not set):
        ```ts
        // file: ~/pages/some-page.vue
        <template>
          <div>I'm a secret! My protection works via the named `nuxt-auth` module middleware.</div>
        </template>

        <script setup lang="ts">
        // This only makes sense when you don't set `enableGlobalAppMiddleware: true` in the `nuxt.config.ts`
        definePageMeta({ middleware: 'auth' })
        </script>
        ```
    - server-side (e.g., from `~/server/api/session.get.ts`):
        ```ts
        import { getServerSession } from '#auth'

        export default eventHandler(async (event) => {
          const session = await getServerSession(event)
          if (!session) {
            return { status: 'unauthenticated!' }
          }
          return { status: 'authenticated!', text: 'im protected by an in-endpoint check', session }
        })
        ```

There's more supported methods in the `useSession` composable, you can create [universal-application-](#middleware) and [server-api-middleware](#server-side-middleware) that make use of the authentication status and more. All of this is [documented below](#documentation).

You can find the [demo source-code here](https://github.com/sidebase/nuxt-auth-example).

## Documentation

The `nuxt-auth` module takes care of authentication and sessions:
- authentication: The process of ensuring that somebody is who they claims to be, e.g., via a username and password or by trusting an external authority (e.g., oauth via google, amazon, ...)
- sessions: Persist the information that you have been authenticated for some duration across different requests. Additional data can be attached to a session, e.g., a `username`. (Note: If you need only sessions but no authentication, you can check-out [nuxt-session](https://github.com/sidebase/nuxt-session))

In addition, you can use `nuxt-auth` to build authorization on top of the supported authentication + session mechanisms: As soon as you know "whos who", you can use this information to let somebody with the right email adress (for example) into a specific area. Right now, this is not in-scope of `nuxt-auth` itself.

### Configuration

There's two places to configure `nuxt-auth`:
- [`auth`-key in `nuxt.config.ts`](#nuxtconfigts): Configure the module itself, e.g., where the auth-endpoints are, what origin the app is deployed to, ...
- [NuxtAuthHandler](#nuxtauthhandler): Configure the authentication behavior, e.g., what authentication providers to use

For development, using the [Quick Start](#quick-start)-configuration can already bring you quite far..

For a production deployment, you will have to at least set the:
- `origin` inside the `nuxt.config.ts` config (equivalent to `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable),
- `secret` inside the `NuxtAuthHandler` config (equivalent to `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` environment variable)

#### `nuxt.config.ts`

Use the `auth`-key inside your `nuxt.config.ts` to configure the module itself. Below is a full configuration with the default-values set:
```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@sidebase/nuxt-auth'],
  auth: {
    // The module is enabled. Change this to disable the module
    isEnabled: true,

    // The origin is set to the development origin. Change this when deploying to production
    origin: 'http://localhost:3000',

    // The base path to the authentication endpoints. Change this if you want to add your auth-endpoints at a non-default location
    basePath: '/api/auth',

    // Whether to periodically refresh the session. Change this to `true` for a refresh every seconds or set this to a number like `5000` for a refresh every 5000 milliseconds (aka: 5 seconds)
    enableSessionRefreshPeriodically: false,

    // Whether to refresh the session whenever a window focus event happens, i.e, when your user refocuses the window. Set this to `false` to turn this off
    enableSessionRefreshOnWindowFocus: true,

    // Whether to add a global authentication middleware that will protect all pages without exclusion
    enableGlobalAppMiddleware: false
  }
})
```

The `origin` and the `basePath` together are equivalent to the `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable of NextAuth.js

##### origin

**You must set the `origin` in production, this includes when you run `npm run build`!** This is so that `nuxt-auth` can ensure that callbacks for authentication are correct. The `origin` consists out of (up to) 3 parts:
- scheme: `http` or `https`
- host: e.g., `localhost`, `example.org`, `www.sidebase.io`
- port: e.g., `:3000`, `:4444`; leave empty to implicitly set `:80` (this is an internet convention, don't ask)

For [the demo-app](https://nuxt-auth-example.sidebase.io) we set the `origin` to `https://nuxt-auth-example.sidebase.io`. If for some reason required, you can explicitly set the `origin` to `http://localhost:3000` to stop `nuxt-auth` from aborting `npm run build` when the origin is unset.

##### basePath

This is what tells the module where you added the authentication endpoints. Per default the `basePath` is set to `/api/auth`, so that means that the module expects that all requests to `/api/auth/*` will be handled by the `NuxtAuthHandler`.

To statify this, you need to create a [catch-all server-route](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/directory-structure/server#catch-all-route) at that location by creating a file `~/server/api/auth/[...].ts` that exports the `NuxtAuthHandler`, see more on this in the [Quick Start](#quick-start) or in the [configuration section below](#serverapiauthts).

If you want to have the authentication at another location, you can overwrite the `basePath`, e.g., when setting:
- `basePath: "/api/_auth"` -> add the authentication catch-all endpoints into `~/server/api/_auth/[...].ts`
- `basePath: "/_auth"` -> add the authentication catch-all endpoints into `~/server/routes/_auth/[...].ts` (see [Nuxt server-routes docs on this](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/directory-structure/server/#server-routes))

#### NuxtAuthHandler

Use the `NuxtAuthHandler({ ... })` to configure how the authentication itself behaves:
```ts
// file: ~/server/api/auth/[...].ts
import { NuxtAuthHandler } from '#auth'

export default NuxtAuthHandler({
  // your authentication configuration here!
})
```

The `NuxtAuthHandler` accepts [all options that NextAuth.js accepts for its API initialization](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#options). Use this place to configure authentication providers (oauth-google, credential flow, ...), your `secret` (equivalent to `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` in NextAuth.js), add callbacks for authentication events, configure a custom logger and more. Read the linked `NextAuth.js` configuration to figure out how this works and what you can do.

##### Example with two providers

Here's what a full config can look like, we allow authentication via:
- a Github Oauth flow
- a username + password flow (called `CredentialsProvider`)

```ts
// file: ~/server/api/auth/[...].ts
import CredentialsProvider from 'next-auth/providers/credentials'
import GithubProvider from 'next-auth/providers/github'
import { NuxtAuthHandler } from '#auth'

export default NuxtAuthHandler({
  providers: [
    // @ts-ignore Import is exported on .default during SSR, so we need to call it this way. May be fixed via Vite at some point
    GithubProvider.default({
      clientId: 'your-client-id',
      clientSecret: 'your-client-secret'
    }),
    // @ts-ignore Import is exported on .default during SSR, so we need to call it this way. May be fixed via Vite at some point
    CredentialsProvider.default({
      // The name to display on the sign-in form (e.g. 'Sign-in with...')
      name: 'Credentials',
      // The credentials is used to generate a suitable form on the sign-in page.
      // You can specify whatever fields you are expecting to be submitted.
      // e.g. domain, username, password, 2FA token, etc.
      // You can pass any HTML attribute to the <input> tag through the object.
      credentials: {
        username: { label: 'Username', type: 'text', placeholder: '(hint: jsmith)' },
        password: { label: 'Password', type: 'password', placeholder: '(hint: hunter2)' }
      },
      authorize (credentials: any) {
        // You need to provide your own logic here that takes the credentials
        // submitted and returns either a object representing a user or value
        // that is false/null if the credentials are invalid.
        // NOTE: THE BELOW LOGIC IS NOT SAFE OR PROPER FOR AUTHENTICATION!

        const user = { id: '1', name: 'J Smith', username: 'jsmith', password: 'hunter2' }

        if (credentials?.username === user.username && credentials?.password === user.password) {
          // Any object returned will be saved in `user` property of the JWT
          return user
        } else {
          // eslint-disable-next-line no-console
          console.error('Warning: Malicious login attempt registered, bad credentials provided')
          // If you return null then an error will be displayed advising the user to check their details.
          return null
          // You can also Reject this callback with an Error thus the user will be sent to the error page with the error message as a query parameter
        }
      }
    })
  ]
})
```

Note: There's more possible options for the `nextAuth.options` object, see [here](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#options) for all available options.

Note: The above credential-provider example is taken over in part from the [NextAuth.js credentials example](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/providers/credentials). It is _not_ considered safe for production usage and you would need to adapt it further, e.g., by calling another service that provides authentication, such as [strapi](#example-with-a-custom-strapi-jwt-provider)

##### Example with a custom Strapi JWT provider

This section gives an example of how the `NuxtAuthHandler` can be configured to use Strapi JWTs for authentication via the `CredentialsProvider` provider.

You have to configure the following places to make `nuxt-auth` work with Strapi:
- `STRAPI_BASE_URL` in `.env`: Add the Strapi environment variable to your .env file
- [`runtimeConfig.STRAPI_BASE_URL`-key in `nuxt.config.ts`](#nuxtconfigts): Add the Strapi base url env variable to the runtime config
- [`auth`-key in `nuxt.config.ts`](#nuxtconfigts): Configure the module itself, e.g., where the auth-endpoints are, what origin the app is deployed to, ...
- [NuxtAuthHandler](#nuxtauthhandler): Configure the authentication behavior, e.g., what authentication providers to use

For a production deployment, you will have to at least set the:
- `STRAPI_BASE_URL` Strapi base URL for all API endpoints by default http://localhost:1337

1. Create a `.env` file with the following lines:
```env
// Strapi v4 url, out of the box
 ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
 NUXT_SECRET=a-not-so-good-secret
 STRAPI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:1337/api
```

2. Set the following options in your `nuxt.config.ts`:
```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  runtimeConfig: {
    // The private keys which are only available server-side
    NUXT_SECRET: process.env.NUXT_SECRET,
    // Default http://localhost:1337/api
    STRAPI_BASE_URL: process.env.STRAPI_BASE_URL,
  },
  auth: {
    origin: process.env.ORIGIN,
  },
});
```

3. Create the catch-all `NuxtAuthHandler` and add the this custom Strapi credentials provider:
```ts
// file: ~/server/api/auth/[...].ts
import CredentialsProvider from "next-auth/providers/credentials";
import { NuxtAuthHandler } from "#auth";
const config = useRuntimeConfig()

export default NuxtAuthHandler({
  secret: config.NUXT_SECRET,
  providers: [
    // @ts-ignore Import is exported on .default during SSR, so we need to call it this way. May be fixed via Vite at some point
    CredentialsProvider.default({
      name: "Credentials",
      credentials: {},  // Object is required but can be left empty.
      async authorize(credentials: any) {
        const response = await $fetch(
          `${config.STRAPI_BASE_URL}/auth/local/`,
          {
            method: "POST",
            body: JSON.stringify({
              identifier: credentials.username,
              password: credentials.password,
            }),
          }
        );

        if (response.user) {
          const u = {
            id: response.id,
            name: response.user.username,
            email: response.user.email,
          };
          return u;
        } else {
          return null
        }
      },
    }),
  ]
});
```

### Application-side usage

This module allows you user-data access, signing in, signing out and more [via `useSession`](#session-access-and-manipulation). It also allows you to defined [middleware that protects pages](#middleware).

Application-side usage refers to any code like pages, components or composables that are part of the universal server- and client-side rendering of Nuxt, see more in the [glossary](#glossary).

#### Session access and manipulation

The `useSession` composable is your main gateway to accessing and manipulating session-state and data. Here's the main methdos you can use:

```ts
const {
  status,
  data,
  lastRefreshedAt,
  getCsrfToken,
  getProviders,
  getSession,
  signIn,
  signOut,
} = useSession()

// Session status, either `unauthenticated`, `loading`, `authenticated`, see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#signout
status.value

// Session data, either `undefined` (= authentication not attempted), `null` (= user unauthenticated), `loading` (= session loading in progress), see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#signout
data.value

// Time at which the session was last refreshed, either `undefined` is no refresh was attempted or a `Date`-object of the time the refresh happened
lastRefreshedAt.value

// Get / Reload the current session from the server, pass `{ required: true }` to force a login if no session exists, see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#getsession
await getSession()

// Get the current CSRF token, usually you do not need this function, see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#signout
await getCsrfToken()

// Get the supported providers, e.g., to build your own login page, see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#getproviders
await getProviders()

// Trigger a sign-in, see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#signin
await signIn()

// Trigger a sign-in with a redirect afterwards, see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#signin
await signIn(undefined, { callbackUrl: '/protected' })

// Trigger a sign-in via a specific authentication provider with a redirect afterwards, see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#signin
await signIn('github', { callbackUrl: '/protected' })

// Trigger a sign-in with username and password already passed, e.g., from your own custom-made sign-in form
await singIn('credentials', { username: 'jsmith', password: 'hunter2' })

// Trigger a sign-out, see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#signout
await signOut()

// Trigger a sign-out and send the user to the sign-out page afterwards
await signOut({ calbackUrl: '/signout' })
```

Session `data.value` has the following interface:
```ts
interface DefaultSession {
  user?: {
    name?: string | null;
    email?: string | null;
    image?: string | null;
  };
  expires: ISODateString;
}
```

Note that this is only set when the use is logged-in and when the provider used to login the user provides the fields.

##### Redirects

You can also pass the `callbackUrl` option to both the `signIn` and the `signOut` method. This allows you to redirect a user to a certain pages, after they've completed the action. This can be useful when a user attempts to open a page (`/protected`) but has to go through external authentication (e.g., via their google account) first.

You can use it like:
```ts
await signIn({ callbackUrl: '/protected' })
```

to redirect the user to the protected page they wanted to access _after_ they've been authenticated.

You can do the same for signing out the user:
```ts
await signOut({ callbackUrl: '/protected' })
```

E.g., to redirect the user away from the already loaded, protected, page after signout (else, you will have to handle the redirect yourself).

You may also pass specify a callback for the `getSession` utility:
```ts
await getSession({ callbackUrl: '/protected' })
```

##### Custom sign-in page

To create a custom sign-in page you will need to:
1. Create the custom sign-in page: Creating the actual page your user will enter their credentials on OR select their oauth provider (e.g., google, azure, ...)
2. Configure `nuxt-auth` to redirect to the custom sign-in page: If a sign-in is triggered or a session check fails, `nuxt-auth` has to forward you to your custom sign-in page, instead of the `nuxt-auth` builtin sign-in page

###### Create the custom sign-in page

To create your custom sign-in page you can use `signIn` to directly start a provider-flow once the user selected it, e.g., by clicking on a button on your custom sign-in page. Here is a very simple sign-in page that either directly starts a github-oauth sign-in flow or directly signs in the user via the credentials flow:
```vue
<!-- file: ~/pages/login.vue -->
<template>
  <div>
    <p>Sign-In Options:</p>
    <button @click="signIn('github')">Github</button>
    <!-- NOTE: Here we hard-coded username and password, on your own page this should probably be connected to two inputs for username + password -->
    <button @click="signIn('credentials', { username: 'test', password: 'hunter2' })">Username and Password</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
const { signIn } = useSession()
</script>
```

Note:
- In the above example `username` and `password` are hard-coded. In your own custom page, these two fields should probably come from inputs on your page.
- We set `required: false` in `useSession`, as the user is _not_ expected to have an active session when they are on the custom sign-in page

If you want to create a custom sign-in page that dynamically offers sign-in options based on your configured providers, you can call `getProviders()` first and then iterate over the supported providers to generate your sign-in page.

###### Configure `nuxt-auth` to redirect to the custom sign-in page

Redirects to the sign-in page happen automatically, e.g., when a `getSession()` call fails to get a session or when `signIn()` is called. By default this redirect sends the user to `/api/auth/signin`. To use a custom sign-in page we will have to configure `nuxt-auth` to send the user to the custom sign-in page instead.

We can apply this configuration in the `NuxtAuthHandler`:
```ts
// file: ~/server/api/auth/[...].ts
import { NuxtAuthHandler } from '#auth'

export default NuxtAuthHandler({
  pages: {
    // Change the default behavior to use `/login` as the path for the sign-in page
    signIn: '/login'
  },
  providers: [
    // ... your provider configuration
  ]
})
```

We can also configure the default-location for other pages in the `pages` configuration, see [the NextAuth.js pages docs for more](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/pages).

#### Middleware

The `nuxt-auth` module comes with an included [middleware](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/directory-structure/middleware#middleware-directory) to authenticate users in your application. The middleware can either be enabled [globally to protect all pages](#global-middleware) or [locally inside specific pages](#local-middleware).

The middleware will check whether a user is authenticated. If the user is not they are forced to login, but will be redirected to the page they originally wanted to visit after logging in. If the user is authenticated, they will be forwarded to their desired page.

##### Global middleware

To create a global authentication middleware that ensures that your user is authenticated no matter which page they visit, you configure `nuxt-auth` as follows:
```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@sidebase/nuxt-auth'],
  auth: {
    enableGlobalAppMiddleware: true
  }
})
```

That's it! Every page of your application will now need authentication for the user to visit it.

###### Disabling the global middleware locally

To disable the global middleware on a specific page only, you can use the [`definePageMeta` macro](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/define-page-meta#definepagemeta) to turn `auth` off:
```vue
<!-- file: ~/pages/unprotected.vue -->
<template>
  <div>I'm publicly available!</div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
definePageMeta({ auth: false })
</script>
```

##### Local middleware

To protect specific pages with a middleware, you can use the [`definePageMeta` macro](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/define-page-meta#definepagemeta) to turn `auth` on:
```vue
<!-- file: ~/pages/unprotected.vue -->
<template>
  <div>I'm publicly available!</div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
definePageMeta({ middleware: 'auth' })
</script>
```

Note: You cannot use local protection when you turned on the global middleware by setting `enableGlobalAppMiddleware: true` in the `nuxt-auth` configuration. You will get an error along the lines of "Error: Unknown route middleware: 'auth'". This is because the `auth` middleware is then added globally and not available to use as a local, page-specific middleware.

#### Server-side usage

On the server side you can get access to the current session like this:
```ts
import { getServerSession } from '#auth'

export default eventHandler(async (event) => {
  const session = await getServerSession(event)
})
```

This is inspired by [the `getServerSession`](https://next-auth.js.org/tutorials/securing-pages-and-api-routes#securing-api-routes) of NextAuth.js. It also avoids an external, internet call to the `GET /api/auth/sessions` endpoint, instead directly calling a pure JS-method.

##### Server-side endpoint protection

To protect an endpoint with, check the session after fetching it:
```ts
// file: ~/server/api/protected.get.ts
import { getServerSession } from '#auth'

export default eventHandler(async (event) => {
  const session = await getServerSession(event)
  if (!session) {
    return { status: 'unauthenticated!' }
  }
  return { status: 'authenticated!' }
})

```

##### Server-side middleware

You can also use this in a [Nuxt server middleware](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/directory-structure/server#server-middleware) to protect multiple pages at once and keep the authentication logic out of your endpoints:
```ts
// file: ~/server/middleware/auth.ts
import { getServerSession } from '#auth'

export default eventHandler(async (event) => {
  const session = await getServerSession(event)
  if (!session) {
    throw createError({ statusMessage: 'Unauthenticated', statusCode: 403 })
  }
})
```

##### Getting the JWT Token

Getting the (decoded) JWT token of the current user can be helpful, e.g., to use it to access an external api that requires this token for authentication or authorization.

You can get the JWT token that was passed along with the request using `getToken`:
```ts
// file: ~/server/api/token.get.ts
import { getToken } from '#auth'

export default eventHandler(async (event) => {
  const token = await getToken({ event })

  return token || 'no token present'
})
```

The function behaves identical to the [`getToken` function from NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/tutorials/securing-pages-and-api-routes#using-gettoken) with one change: you have to pass in the h3-`event` instead of `req`. This is due to how cookies can be accessed on h3: not via `req.cookies` but rather via `useCookies(event)`.

You do not need to pass in any further parameters like `secret`, `secureCookie`, ... They are automatically inferred to the values you configured if not set and reading the token will work out of the box. You _may_ pass these options, e.g., to get the raw, encoded JWT token you can pass `raw: true`.

###### Application-side JWT token access

To access the JWT token application-side, e.g., in a `.vue` page, you can create an endpoint like this:
```ts
// file: ~/server/api/token.get.ts
import { getToken } from '#auth'

export default eventHandler(event => getToken({ event }))
```

Then from your application-side code you can fetch it like this:
```vue
// file: app.vue
<template>
  <div>{{ token || 'no token present, are you logged in?' }}</div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
const headers = useRequestHeaders(['cookie'])
const { data: token } = await useFetch('/api/token', { headers: { cookie: headers.cookie } })
</script>
```

Note that you have to pass the cookie-header manually. You also have to pass it using [`useRequestHeaders`](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/api/composables/use-request-headers/) so that the cookies are also correctly passed when this page is rendered server-side during the [universal-rendering process](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/concepts/rendering#universal-rendering).

#### REST API

All endpoints that NextAuth.js supports are also supported by `nuxt-auth`:
- `GET /signin`,
- `POST /signin/:provider`,
- `GET/POST /callback/:provider`,
- `GET /signout`,
- `POST /signout`,
- `GET /session`,
- `GET /csrf`,
- `GET /providers`

You can directly interact with them if you wish to, it's probably a better idea to use `useSession` where possible though. [See the full rest API documentation of NextAuth.js here](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/rest-api).

#### Security

This section mostly contains a list of possible security problems. Note that the below flaws exist with many libraries and frameworks we use in our day-to-day when building and working with APIs. Even your vanilla Nuxt app already posesses some of these shortcoming. Missing in the below list are estimates of how likely it is that one of the list-items may occur and what impact it will have on your app. This is because that heavily depends on:
- your app: Are you building a fun project? A proof of concept? The next fort-nox money management app?
- your environment: Building a freely available app for fun? Have authentication in front of your app and trust all users that successfully authenticated? Superb! Don't trust anyone? Then please be extra-careful when using this library and when building you backend in general

Without further ado, here's some attack cases you can consider and take action against. Neither the attack vectors, the problems or the mitigations are exhaustive:
1. sending arbitrary data: Denial-of-Service by server-ressource exhaustion (bandwidth, cpu, memory), arbitrary code execution (if you parse the data), ...
2. creation arbitrarily many sessions: Denial-of-Service by server-ressource exhaustion (bandwidth, cpu, memory)
3. guessing correct session ids: session data can leak
4. stealing session id(s) of client(s): session data can leak

Read up how to mitigate these and more issues if you see fit. Checkout the [`nuxt-security`](https://github.com/Baroshem/nuxt-security) module that may help with some of these.

##### Disclosure

A last reminder: This library was not written by crypto- or security-experts. Please proceed at your own risk, inspect the code if you want to and open issues / pull requests where you see room for improvement. If you want to file a security-concern privately, please send an email to `support@sidestream.tech` with the subject saying "SECURITY nuxt-auth" and we'll look into your request ASAP.

#### Glossary

There are some terms we use in this documentation that may not immeadiatly be known to every reader. Here is an explanation for some of them:
- `application` / `application-side` / `universal-application`: This references all Nuxt code of your app that is [universally rendered](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/concepts/rendering#universal-rendering). In short this means that that code is rendered on the server-side and on the client-side, so all JS in it is executed twice. This is an important distinction, as some things may behave different on the server-side than on the client-side. We use `application...` to denote something that will be universally rendered
- `server` / `server-side`: This references all Nuxt code of your app that will run **only** on your server. For example, all code inside the `~/server` directory should only ever run on the server

#### Prior Work and Module Concept

The idea of this library is to re-use all the open-source implementation that already exist in the JS ecosystem instead of rolling our own. The idea was born when researching through the ecosystem of framework-specific authentication libraries to figure out what the best implementation approach for a state-of-the-art Nuxt 3 authentication library would be.

During research it became clear that implementing everything from scratch will be:
- a lot of work that has already been open-sourced by others,
- error prone as authentication has a lot of intricacies that need to be resolved in order to get it right,
- hard to maintain as authentication providers come and go,
- hard to build initial trust for as authentication is important and cannot go wrong,

In order to avoid these problems without taking forever (leaving Nuxt without an authentication library in the meantime), we decided to investigate if we can wrap [`NextAuth.js`](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth), the most popular authentication library in the Next.js ecosystem by far and a trusted, well maintained one at that!

In our investigation we found prior attempts to make NextAuth.js framework agnostic. These have more or less come to fruition, so far mostly resulting in some PoCs and example apps. Looking at these was quite helpful to get started. In particular, big pushes in the right direction came from:
- [NextAuth.js app examples](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/tree/main/apps)
- [Various comments, proposals, ... of this thread](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/discussions/3942), special thanks to @brillout for starting the discussion, @balazsorban44 for NextAuth.js and encouraging the discussion, @wobsoriano for adding PoCs for multiple languages

The main part of the work was to piece everything together, resolve some outstanding issues with existing PoCs, add new things where nothing existed yet, e.g., for the `useSession` composable by going through the NextAuth.js client code and translating it to a Nuxt 3 approach.

The module had another big iteration in collaboration with @JoaoPedroAS51 to make `useSession` a sync operation and trigger the session lifecycle from a plugin rather than the `useSession` composable itself.

##### Project Roadmap

This project is under active development: A lot of stuff already works and as NextAuth.js handles the authentication under the hood, the module should already be ready for most use-cases. Still, some functionality is missing, e.g., we've focused on oauth-providers in the first implementation, so the credential- and email-flow are untested.

Roughly, the priorities of `nuxt-auth` are:
1. Reach feature parity: There's some options, configuration and behavior from NextAuth.js that we do not support yet. We first want to reach feature parity on this. If any missing feature is of particular relevance to you: [Open an issue](https://github.com/sidebase/nuxt-auth/issues/new)
2. Add some of our own: There's ideas we have to support extended user management, e.g., discuss whether we want to better support the `local` / `credentials` flow than NextAuth.js does out of the box (they don't do it for good reasons, so, there really is an honest discussion to be had), adding more UI focused components that automatically and easily wrap your app in a nice auth page, ...

We also want to listen to all suggestions, feature requests, bug reports, ... from you. So if you have any ideas, please open an issue or reach out to us on Twitter or via E-Mail.

#### Module Playground

This module also has it's own playground, you can also use that to get familiar with it and play around a bit:
```sh
> git clone https://github.com/sidebase/nuxt-auth

> cd nuxt-auth

# **OPEN THE `~/playground/server/api/auth/[...].ts` and configure your own auth-provider

> npm i

> npm run dev:prepare

> npm run dev

# -> open http://localhost:3000
```

Note: The playground has considerably less polishing than the example page.

#### Development

- Run `npm run dev:prepare` to generate type stubs.
- Use `npm run dev` to start [the module playground](./playground) in development mode.
- Run `npm run lint` to run eslint
- Run `npm run types` to run typescheck via tsc
- Run `npm publish --access public` to publish (bump version before)
