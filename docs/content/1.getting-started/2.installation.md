# Installation

You can install `nuxt-auth` using `nuxi`:
```bash
npx nuxi@latest module add sidebase-auth
```

## Specifics: `authjs`-Provider

If you want to use the `authjs` provider, you have to install `next-auth`. With all package managers except `npm` you must manually install the peer dependency alongside `nuxt-auth`:
::code-group
```bash [yarn]
yarn add next-auth@4.22.5
```
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i next-auth@4.22.5
```
::

::alert{type="warning"}
Due to a breaking change in NextAuth, nuxt-auth is only compoatible with NextAuth versions under v4.23.0. We recommend pinning the version to `4.22.5`. See more [here](https://github.com/sidebase/nuxt-auth/issues/514).

::alert{type="info"}
Note that we try our best to keep `nuxt-auth` stable, but it is also a fresh module that is in active development. If you want to be extra sure nothing breaks, you should pin the patch version, e.g., by using `--save-exact` when running the install command.
::

You can find all available `next-auth` versions [on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-auth?activeTab=versions). You do not need to install any other peer-dependencies in order to use `nuxt-auth`.

If you are unsure which provider to choose, have a look at the [overview on the getting-started page](/nuxt-auth/v0.6/getting-started#which-provider-should-i-pick).

## Specifics: `local`/`refresh`-Provider

The `local` provider does not have any specific extra dependencies. However, you will need to make sure that you have a backend somewhere that provides username + password based authentication, [read more about this on the quick-start page](/nuxt-auth/v0.6/getting-started/quick-start).

## Requirements

`nuxt-auth` only needs Nuxt 3 to run. In the future Nuxt 2 or Nuxt Bridge may be supported.
