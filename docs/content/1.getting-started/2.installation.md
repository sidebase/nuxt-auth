# Installation

You can install `nuxt-auth` via `npm`, `yarn` or `pnpm`:
::code-group
```bash [npm]
npm i -D @sidebase/nuxt-auth
```
```bash [yarn]
yarn add --dev @sidebase/nuxt-auth
```
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i -D @sidebase/nuxt-auth
```
::

::alert{type="info"}
Note that we try our best to keep `nuxt-auth` stable, but it is also a young module that is in active development. If you want to be extra sure nothing breaks, you should pin the patch version, e.g., by using `--save-exact` when running the install command.
::

`nuxt-auth` has `next-auth` as a peer-dependency. If you need a specific `next-auth` version, you should manually install it alongside `nuxt-auth`. E.g.:
::code-group
```bash [npm]
npm i next-auth@X.Y.Z
```
```bash [yarn]
yarn add next-auth@X.Y.Z
```
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i next-auth@X.Y.Z
```
::

You can find all available `next-auth` versions [on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-auth?activeTab=versions).

## Requirements

`nuxt-auth` only needs Nuxt 3 to run. In the future Nuxt 2 or Nuxt Bridge may be supported.
