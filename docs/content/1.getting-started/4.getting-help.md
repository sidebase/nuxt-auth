# Getting Help

At some point, you may find that there's an issue you need some help with.

But don't worry! We're a friendly community of developers and we'd love to help. Concretely this means to:
- Checkout the docs (page that you are currently viewing),
- Search open issues and discussions: https://github.com/sidebase/nuxt-auth/issues
- Hop on Discord to ask us directly: https://discord.gg/VzABbVsqAc,
- Open an issue to file a bug, ask for an enhancement or get an answer to a question: https://github.com/sidebase/nuxt-auth/issues/new/choose

We aim to follow the getting-help standards of the nuxt-project as described here and ask you to do the same when opening an issue or pinging us for help: https://nuxt.com/docs/community/getting-help#getting-help.
