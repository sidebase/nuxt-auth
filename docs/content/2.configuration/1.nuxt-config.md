# nuxt.config.ts

Use the `auth`-key inside your `nuxt.config.ts` to configure the module itself. Right now this is limited to the following options:
```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@sidebase/nuxt-auth'],
  auth: {
    // The module is enabled. Change this to disable the module
    isEnabled: true,

    // The origin is set to the development origin. Change this when deploying to production
    origin: 'http://localhost:300',

    // The base path to the authentication endpoints. Change this if you want to add your auth-endpoints at a non-default location
    basePath: '/api/auth'
  }
})
```

The `origin` and the `basePath` together are equivalent to the `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable of NextAuth.js

## origin

**You must set the `origin` in production, this includes when you run `npm run build`!** This is so that `nuxt-auth` can ensure that callbacks for authentication are correct. The `origin` consists out of (up to) 3 parts:
- scheme: `http` or `https`
- host: e.g., `localhost`, `example.org`, `www.sidebase.io`
- port: e.g., `:3000`, `:4444`; leave empty to implicitly set `:80` (this is an internet convention, don't ask)

For [the demo-app](https://nuxt-auth-example.sidebase.io) we set the `origin` to `https://nuxt-auth-example.sidebase.io`. If for some reason required, you can explicitly set the `origin` to `http://localhost:3000` to stop `nuxt-auth` from aborting `npm run build` when the origin is unset.

## basePath

This is what tells the module where you added the authentication endpoints. Per default the `basePath` is set to `/api/auth`, so that means that the module expects that all requests to `/api/auth/*` will be handled by the `NuxtAuthHandler`.

To statify this, you need to create a [catch-all server-route](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/directory-structure/server#catch-all-route) at that location by creating a file `~/server/api/auth/[...].ts` that exports the `NuxtAuthHandler`, see more on this in the [Quick Start](#quick-start) or in the [configuration section below](#serverapiauthts).

If you want to have the authentication at another location, you can overwrite the `basePath`, e.g., when setting:
- `basePath: "/api/_auth"` -> add the authentication catch-all endpoints into `~/server/api/_auth/[...].ts`
- `basePath: "/_auth"` -> add the authentication catch-all endpoints into `~/server/routes/_auth/[...].ts` (see [Nuxt server-routes docs on this](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/directory-structure/server/#server-routes))

## NuxtAuthHandler

Use the `NuxtAuthHandler({ ... })` to configure how the authentication itself behaves:
```ts
// file: ~/server/api/auth/[...].ts
import { NuxtAuthHandler } from '#auth'

export default NuxtAuthHandler({
  // your authentication configuration here!
})
```

The `NuxtAuthHandler` accepts [all options that NextAuth.js accepts for its API initialization](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#options). Use this place to configure authentication providers (oauth-google, credential flow, ...), your `secret` (equivalent to `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` in NextAuth.js), add callbacks for authentication events, configure a custom logger and more. Read the linked `NextAuth.js` configuration to figure out how this works and what you can do.
