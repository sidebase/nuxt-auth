# Module (nuxt.config.ts)

Use the `auth`-key inside the `nuxt.config.ts` to configure the `nuxt-auth` module itself. Here are the available configuration options and their default values:
```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@sidebase/nuxt-auth'],
  auth: {
    // The module is enabled. Change this to disable the module
    isEnabled: true,

    // The origin is set to the development origin. Change this when deploying to production by setting `origin` in this config before build-time or by exporting `AUTH_ORIGIN` by running `export AUTH_ORIGIN=...`
    origin: 'http://localhost:3000',

    // The base path to the authentication endpoints. Change this if you want to add your auth-endpoints at a non-default location
    basePath: '/api/auth',

    // Whether to periodically refresh the session. Change this to `true` for a refresh every seconds or set this to a number like `5000` for a refresh every 5000 milliseconds (aka: 5 seconds)
    enableSessionRefreshPeriodically: false,

    // Whether to refresh the session whenever a window focus event happens, i.e, when your user refocuses the window. Set this to `false` to turn this off
    enableSessionRefreshOnWindowFocus: true,

    // Whether to add a global authentication middleware that will protect all pages without exclusion
    enableGlobalAppMiddleware: false,

    // Select the default-provider to use when `signIn` is called. Setting this here will also effect the global middleware behavior: E.g., when you set it to `github` and the user is unauthorized, they will be directly forwarded to the Github OAuth page instead of seeing the app-login page
    defaultProvider: undefined

    // Configuration of the global auth-middleware (only applies if you set `enableGlobalAppMiddleware: true` above!)
    globalMiddlewareOptions: {

        // Whether to allow access to 404 pages without authentication. Set this to `false` to force users to sign-in before seeing `404` pages. Setting this to false may lead to vue-router problems (as the target page does not exist)
        allow404WithoutAuth: true
    }
  }
})
```

The `origin` and the `basePath` together are equivalent to the [`NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable of NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#nextauth_url)

## origin

**You must set the `origin` in production!** You have two options to set it:
1. Set the `AUTH_ORIGIN` environment variable _at runtime_
2. Set the `origin` origin-config key inside the `nuxt.config.ts` (see an example above) _at build-time_

The `AUTH_ORIGIN` environment variable takes precendence over the `origin` configuration key, so you can always overwrite the origin at deploy-time.

The origin must be set so that `nuxt-auth` can ensure that callbacks for authentication are correct. The `origin` consists out of (up to) 3 parts:
- scheme: `http` or `https`
- host: e.g., `localhost`, `example.org`, `www.sidebase.io`
- port: e.g., `:3000`, `:4444`; leave empty to implicitly set `:80` (this is an internet convention, don't ask)

For the demo-app at https://nuxt-auth-example.sidebase.io we set the `origin` to `https://nuxt-auth-example.sidebase.io`. If for some reason required, you can explicitly set the `origin` to `http://localhost:3000` to stop `nuxt-auth` from aborting `npm run build` when the origin is unset.

## basePath

This is what tells the module where you added the authentication endpoints. Per default the `basePath` is set to `/api/auth`, so that means that the module expects that all requests to `/api/auth/*` will be handled by the `NuxtAuthHandler`.

To statify this, you need to create a [catch-all server-route](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/pages/#catch-all-route) at that location by creating a file `~/server/api/auth/[...].ts` that exports the `NuxtAuthHandler`, see more on this in the [Quick Start](/nuxt-auth/getting-started/quick-start) or in the [`NuxtAuthHandler` documentation](/nuxt-auth/configuration/nuxt-auth-handler)

If you want to have the authentication at another location, you can overwrite the `basePath`, e.g., when setting:
- `basePath: "/api/_auth"` -> add the authentication catch-all endpoints into `~/server/api/_auth/[...].ts`
- `basePath: "/_auth"` -> add the authentication catch-all endpoints into `~/server/routes/_auth/[...].ts`

See [Nuxt server-routes docs on catch-all routes for a further explanation.](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/server#server-routes)

## enableGlobalAppMiddleware

This is a middleware that comes included with `nuxt-auth`. When you enable it, it will protect _all_ pages, so even your index page (`/`) will not be accessible without a login anymore.
