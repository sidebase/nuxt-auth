# Module (nuxt.config.ts)

Use the `auth`-key inside the `nuxt.config.ts` to configure the `nuxt-auth` module itself. The module config has a root-config and then sub-properties for different aspects of the module:
::code-group
```ts [root]
/**
 * Configuration for the whole module.
 */
interface ModuleOptions {
  /**
   * Whether the module is enabled at all
   */
  isEnabled?: boolean
  /**
   * Full url at which the app will run combined with the path to authentication. You can set this differently depending on your selected authentication-provider:
   * - `authjs`: You must set the full URL, with origin and path in production. You can leave this empty in development
   * - `local`: You can set a full URL, but can also leave this empty to fallback to the default value of `/api/auth` or set only the path.
   *
   * ### `authjs`
   *
   * `baseURL` can be `undefined` during development but _must_ be set to the combination of origin + path that points to your `NuxtAuthHandler` for production. The origin consists out of:
   * - `scheme`: http / https
   * - `host`: e.g., localhost, example.org, google.com
   * - `port`: _empty_ (implies `:80` for http and `:443` for https), :3000, :8888
   *
   * The path then is a string like `/path/to/auth/api/endpoint/root`.
   *
   * ### `local`
   *
   * Defaults to `/api/auth` for both development and production. Setting this is optional, if you set it you can set it to either:
   * - just a path: Will lead to `nuxt-auth` using `baseURL` as a relative path appended to the origin you deploy to. Example: `/backend/auth`
   * - an origin and a path: Will leav to `nuxt-auth` using `baseURL` as an absolute request path to perform requests to. Example: `https://example.com/auth`
   *
   * Note: If you point to a different origin than the one you deploy to you likely have to take care of CORS: Allowing cross origin requests.
   *
   * @example undefined
   * @example http://localhost:3000
   * @example https://example.org/_auth
   * @example https://my-cool-site.com/api/authentication
   * @default http://localhost:3000/api/auth Default for `authjs` provider in development
   * @default undefined                      Default for `authjs` in production, will result in an error
   * @default /api/auth                      Default for `local` for both production and development
   */

## Additional Information

### Provider `authjs` - baseURL

**You must set the `baseURL` in production for this provider!** You have two options to set it:
1. Set the `AUTH_ORIGIN` environment variable _at runtime_
2. Set the `baseURL` baseURL-config key inside the `nuxt.config.ts` (see an example above) _at build-time_
    - Note: Setting this at build time will result in this being hard-backed on the application side if you do not use server-side-rendering
    - Note: It's called `baseURL` because it must contain both `origin` and `path` that point to the auth handler, see the long docstring above

It is advised to use the `AUTH_ORIGIN` environment variable if possible. The `AUTH_ORIGIN` environment variable takes precendence over the `baseURL` configuration key, so you can always overwrite the origin at deploy-time.

The `baseURL` must be set so that `nuxt-auth` can ensure that callbacks for authentication are correct. Examples of a `baseURL` with both origin and path are:
- `https://example.org/api/auth`
- `http://localhost:2345/_auth`
- `https://app.company.com/api/auth`

#### Explanation: What is an origin?

The `origin` consists out of (up to) 3 parts:
- scheme: `http` or `https`
- host: e.g., `localhost`, `example.org`, `www.sidebase.io`
- port: e.g., `:3000`, `:4444`; leave empty to implicitly set `:80` for http, and `:443` for https (this is an internet convention, don't ask)

For the demo-app at https://nuxt-auth-example.sidebase.io we set the `origin` to `https://nuxt-auth-example.sidebase.io`. If for some reason required, you can explicitly set the `origin` to `http://localhost:3000` to stop `nuxt-auth` from aborting `npm run build` when the origin is unset.

#### Explanation: What is the path?

This is what tells the module where you added the authentication endpoints. By default this documentation recommends to use `/api/auth`, so that means that the module expects that all requests to `/api/auth/*` will be handled by the `NuxtAuthHandler`.

To statify this, you need to create a [catch-all server-route](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/pages/#catch-all-route) at that location by creating a file `~/server/api/auth/[...].ts` that exports the `NuxtAuthHandler`, see more on this in the [Quick Start](/nuxt-auth/v0.6/next/getting-started/quick-start) or in the [`NuxtAuthHandler` documentation](/nuxt-auth/v0.6/next/configuration/nuxt-auth-handler)

If you want to have the authentication at another location, you should change the path, e.g., when setting the path-part of the `baseURL` to:
- `path: "/api/_auth"` -> you need to add the authentication catch-all endpoints into `~/server/api/_auth/[...].ts` and this is where `nuxt-auth` will look
- `path: "/_auth"` -> you need to add the authentication catch-all endpoints into `~/server/routes/_auth/[...].ts` and this is where `nuxt-auth` will look

See [Nuxt server-routes docs on catch-all routes for a further explanation.](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/server#server-routes)
