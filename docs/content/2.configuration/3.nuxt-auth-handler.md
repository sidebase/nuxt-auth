# NuxtAuthHandler

After following the [quick-start setup](/nuxt-auth/v0.6/getting-started/quick-start) and then optionally diving even deeper into the [`nuxt-auth` config inside your `nuxt.config.ts`](/nuxt-auth/v0.6/configuration/nuxt-config) you can begin defining providers and other options inside your `NuxtAuthHandler`.

For development, using the quick-start setup will already bring you quite far. For a production deployment, you will have to additionally:
- set the `origin` by exporting the `AUTH_ORIGIN`-environment variable _at runtime_
- set a secret inside the `NuxtAuthHandler` config

## Creating the `NuxtAuthHandler`

In order to create your own `NuxtAuthHandler`, create the file `~/server/api/auth/[...].ts`. This file will automatically set up the authentication API that responds to all requests going to `https://localhost/api/auth/*`. If you wish you can also use a custom file location and api path, however this change will need to be reflected in the [basePath](/nuxt-auth/v0.6/configuration/nuxt-config#basepath), which is configured in the [nuxt.config.ts](/nuxt-auth/v0.6/configuration/nuxt-config).

::alert{type="warning"}
The filename must be `[...].ts` - this is a so-called "catch-all" route, read more [in the Nuxt catch-all docs](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/server#catch-all-route).

## Configuring the `NuxtAuthHandler`

After creating the file, add the `NuxtAuthHandler({ ... })` to it. The `NuxtAuthHandler({ ... })` is used to configure how the authentication itself behaves, what [callbacks should be called](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/callbacks), what [database adapters should be used](https://next-auth.js.org/adapters) and more:

::code-group
```ts [Empty NuxtAuthHandler]
// file: ~/server/api/auth/[...].ts
import { NuxtAuthHandler } from '#auth'

export default NuxtAuthHandler({
  // your authentication configuration here!
})
```
```ts [NuxtAuthHandler with Github Provider]
// file: ~/server/api/auth/[...].ts
import GithubProvider from 'next-auth/providers/github'
import { NuxtAuthHandler } from '#auth'

export default NuxtAuthHandler({
  // A secret string you define, to ensure correct encryption
  secret: 'your-secret-here',
  providers: [
    // @ts-expect-error You need to use .default here for it to work during SSR. May be fixed via Vite at some point
    GithubProvider.default({
      clientId: 'your-client-id',
      clientSecret: 'your-client-secret'
    })
  ]
})
```
```ts [NuxtAuthHandler with Credentials Provider]
// file: ~/server/api/auth/[...].ts
import CredentialsProvider from 'next-auth/providers/credentials'
import { NuxtAuthHandler } from '#auth'

export default NuxtAuthHandler({
  // A secret string you define, to ensure correct encryption
  secret: 'your-secret-here',
  providers: [
    // @ts-expect-error You need to use .default here for it to work during SSR. May be fixed via Vite at some point
    CredentialsProvider.default({
      // The name to display on the sign in form (e.g. 'Sign in with...')
      name: 'Credentials',
      // The credentials is used to generate a suitable form on the sign in page.
      // You can specify whatever fields you are expecting to be submitted.
      // e.g. domain, username, password, 2FA token, etc.
      // You can pass any HTML attribute to the <input> tag through the object.
      credentials: {
        username: { label: 'Username', type: 'text', placeholder: '(hint: jsmith)' },
        password: { label: 'Password', type: 'password', placeholder: '(hint: hunter2)' }
      },
      authorize (credentials: any) {
        // You need to provide your own logic here that takes the credentials
        // submitted and returns either a object representing a user or value
        // that is false/null if the credentials are invalid.
        // NOTE: THE BELOW LOGIC IS NOT SAFE OR PROPER FOR AUTHENTICATION!

        const user = { id: '1', name: 'J Smith', username: 'jsmith', password: 'hunter2' }

        if (credentials?.username === user.username && credentials?.password === user.password) {
          // Any object returned will be saved in `user` property of the JWT
          return user
        } else {
          // eslint-disable-next-line no-console
          console.error('Warning: Malicious login attempt registered, bad credentials provided')

          // If you return null then an error will be displayed advising the user to check their details.
          return null

          // You can also Reject this callback with an Error thus the user will be sent to the error page with the error message as a query parameter
        }
      }
    })
  ]
})
```

The `NuxtAuthHandler` accepts [all options that NextAuth.js accepts for its API initialization](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#options). Use this place to configure authentication providers (oauth-Google, credential flow, ...), your `secret`, add callbacks for authentication events, configure a custom logger and more. Read the [`NextAuth.js` docs to see all possible options](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#options).

### secret

In theory the only required configuration key for production is the `secret`. You can set it directly inside the `NuxtAuthHandler`. In practice however you may also want to configure at least one provider so that your users can actually login.

To avoid hard-coding of the secret you can make it configurable at runtime by using an environment variable and exporting it at runtime or by using the nuxt runtimeconfig (and then also setting the correct environment at runtime):
::code-group
```ts [Environment Variable]
// file: ~/server/api/auth/[...].ts
import { NuxtAuthHandler } from '#auth'

export default NuxtAuthHandler({
  // A secret string you define, to ensure correct encryption - required in production
  secret: process.env.AUTH_SECRET

  // rest of your authentication configuration here!
})
```
```ts [useRuntimeConfig]
// file: ~/server/api/auth/[...].ts
import { NuxtAuthHandler } from '#auth'

export default NuxtAuthHandler({
  // A secret string you define, to ensure correct encryption - required in production
  secret: useRuntimeConfig().authSecret

  // rest of your authentication configuration here!
})
```
