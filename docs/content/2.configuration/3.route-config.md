# Route Rules

Use the `auth`-key inside the `nuxt.config.ts` `routeRules` to configure page-specific settings.

```ts
interface RouteOptions {
  /**
   * Forces your server to send a "loading" status on a route, prompting the client to fetch on the client. If a specific page has caching, this prevents the server from caching someone's authentication status.
   *
   * @default false
   */
  disableServerSideAuth: boolean;
}
```
