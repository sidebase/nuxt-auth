# Session Config

Use this section to configure the application-side session. The following type defines the options you can use inside your auths `session`-key:

```ts
/**
 * Configuration for the application-side session.
 */
type SessionRefreshConfig = {
  /**
   * Whether to refresh the session every `X` milliseconds. Set this to `false` to turn it off. The session will only be refreshed if a session already exists.
   *
   * Setting this to `true` will refresh the session every second.
   * Setting this to `false` will turn off session refresh.
   * Setting this to a number `X` will refresh the session every `X` milliseconds.
   *
   * @example 1000
   * @default false
   *
   */
  enablePeriodically: number | boolean
  /**
   * Whether to refresh the session every time the browser window is refocused.
   *
   * @example false
   * @default true
   */
  enableOnWindowFocus: boolean
  /**
   * A custom refresh handler to use. This can be used to implement custom session refresh logic.
   * If not set, the default refresh handler will be used.
   *
   * @example ./src/runtime/utils/refreshHandler.ts
   * @default undefined
   */
  handler?: RefreshHandler;
}
```

## Application side session

Per default nuxt-auth will use the set values for `enablePeriodically` & `enableOnWindowFocus` to refresh your application-side session. If you don't provide a configuration nuxt-auth won't trigger a job that refreshes the session periodically but it will always refresh the session if the window is refocussed.

If you set `enablePeriodically` simply to true a job will be run every second (1000ms) that will fetch your specified `getSession` endpoint. You can customize the interval if you provide a number instead of a boolean value.

To disable the session refresh when the window is refocussed simply set `enableOnWindowFocus` to `false`.

## Using a custom RefreshHandler

To customize the session refreshing you can provide a refresh handler. A custom `RefreshHandler` requires an `init`- and a `destroy`-function.

`init` will be called when the nuxt application is mounted. Here you may add event listeners and initialize custom refresh behaviour. The method will receive a `RefreshHandlerConfig`. The type consists of `enablePeriodically` & `enableOnWindowFocus`.

`destroy` will be called when your app is unmounted. Here you may run your clean up routine e.g. to remove your event listeners.

```ts
export type RefreshHandler = {
  /**
   * Initializes the refresh handler with the given configuration.
   * init will be called inside app:mouted lifecycle hook.
   *
   * @param config The configuration to use for the refresh handler.
   */
  init: (config: RefreshHandlerConfig) => void;

  /**
   * Handles cleanup of the refresh handler. This method will be called when the app is destroyed.
   */
  destroy: () => void;
};
```

To get an idea the `defaultRefreshHandler` could be useful.
