# Overview

On the application-side this module offers:
::list{type="success"}
- [`useAuth` composable for session access and management](/nuxt-auth/application-side/session-access-and-management)
::alert{type="info"}
Prior to v0.5.0 `useAuth()` was called `useSession()`.
::
- [Creation of custom sign-in pages](/nuxt-auth/application-side/custom-sign-in-page)
- [Middleware to protect your application on the application side](/nuxt-auth/application-side/protecting-pages)
::

Application-side usage refers to any code like pages, components or composables that are part of the universal server- and client-side rendering of Nuxt, see more in the [glossary](/nuxt-auth/resources/glossary).
