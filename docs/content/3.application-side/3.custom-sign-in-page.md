# Custom sign-in Page

To create a custom sign-in page you will need to:
1. Create the custom sign-in page: Creating the actual page your user will enter their credentials on OR select their oauth provider (e.g., google, azure, ...)
2. Configure `nuxt-auth` to redirect to the custom sign-in page: If a sign-in is triggered or a session check fails, `nuxt-auth` has to forward you to your custom sign-in page, instead of the `nuxt-auth` builtin sign-in page
3. Optional: Disable the `nuxt-auth` global protection middleware for the custom page if you have it enabled

## Create the Custom sign-in Page

To create your custom sign-in page you can use `signIn` to directly start a provider-flow once the user selected it, e.g., by clicking on a button on your custom sign-in page. Here is a very simple sign-in page that either directly starts a github-oauth sign-in flow or directly signs in the user via the credentials flow:
```vue
<!-- file: ~/pages/login.vue -->
<template>
  <div>
    <p>Sign-In Options:</p>
    <button @click="signIn('github')">Github</button>
    <!-- NOTE: Here we hard-coded username and password, on your own page this should probably be connected to two inputs for username + password -->
    <button @click="signIn('credentials', { username: 'test', password: 'hunter2' })">Username and Password</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
definePageMeta({ auth: false })

const { signIn } = useSession()
</script>
```

Note:
- In the above example `username` and `password` are hard-coded. In your own custom page, these two fields should probably come from inputs on your page.
- We disable the global `nuxt-auth` middleware for this page by using `definePageMeta({ auth: false })`, this is only necessary if you have set `enableGlobalAppMiddleware: true` in [the `nuxt-auth` module configuration](/nuxt-auth/configuration/nuxt-config)

If you want to create a custom sign-in page that dynamically offers sign-in options based on your configured providers, you can call `getProviders()` first and then iterate over the supported providers to generate your sign-in page.

## Configure `nuxt-auth` to redirect to the Custom sign-in Page

Redirects to the sign-in page happen automatically, e.g., when a `getSession()` call fails to get a session or when `signIn()` is called. By default this redirect sends the user to `/api/auth/signin`. To use a custom sign-in page we will have to configure `nuxt-auth` to send the user to the custom sign-in page instead.

We can apply this configuration in the `NuxtAuthHandler`:
```ts
// file: ~/server/api/auth/[...].ts
import { NuxtAuthHandler } from '#auth'

export default NuxtAuthHandler({
  pages: {
    // Change the default behavior to use `/login` as the path for the sign-in page
    signIn: '/login'
  },
  providers: [
    // ... your provider configuration
  ]
})
```

We can also configure the default-location for other pages in the `pages` configuration, see [the NextAuth.js pages docs for more](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/pages).

## Disable the global page protection middleware

As already outlined in the first step, you will need to add:
```ts
definePageMeta({ auth: false })
```
to your login page if you have enabled the [global page protection middleware](/nuxt-auth/application-side/protecting-pages). This is so that your users can access the login pages without being forced to login. Not disabling the global middleware would result in an endless loop of redirects.

If you have not set `enableGlobalAppMiddleware` or have set it to `false` this step does not apply to your application.

## Optional: Custom Error handling

You can handle sign-in errors yourself by calling `signIn` with `redirect: false` and inspecting its result for errors. For example:
```ts
const { signIn } = useSession()

const mySignInHandler = async ({ username, password }: { username: string, password: string }) => {
  const { error, url } = await signIn('credentials', { username, password, redirect: false })

  if (error) {
    // Do your custom error handling here
    alert('You have made a terrible mistake while entering your credentials')
  } else {
    // No error, continue with the sign in, e.g., by following the returned redirect:
    return navigateTo(url, { external: true })
  }
}
```

Then call the `mySignInHandler({ username, password })` on login instead of the default `signIn(...)` method. You can find [all possible errors here](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/aad0b8db0e8a163b3c3ae7dec3e9158e20d368f4/packages/next-auth/src/core/pages/signin.tsx#L4-L19). This file also contains the default error-messages that `nuxt-auth` would show to the user if you would not handle the error manually using `redirect: false`.
