# Protecting Pages

`nuxt-auth` offers different approaches to protect pages:
1. Global protection: Protects all pages with manual exceptions
2. Local protection: Protects specific pages
3. Custom middleware: Create your own middleware
4. Guest mode: Only logged out people can view the page, [more here](/nuxt-auth/v0.6/application-side/guest-mode)

Briefly summarized, you can enable global protection (1) in your `nuxt.config.ts`:
```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
   modules: ['@sidebase/nuxt-auth'],
   auth: {
    globalAppMiddleware: true
   }
})
```

Now *all pages*, aside from the login pages will require sign-in. Learn how to add excepted pages [below](/nuxt-auth/v0.6/application-side/protecting-pages#disabling-the-global-middleware-locally)

To enable page-local protection (2), add the following `definePageMeta` directive to a page:
```vue
<!-- file: ~/pages/protected.vue -->
<template>
  <div>I'm protected!</div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
definePageMeta({ middleware: 'auth' })
</script>
```

You cannot mix approach (1) and (2). So, if the global middleware is enabled, you cannot additionally add another protection middleware to a specific page.

## Global middleware

To create a global authentication middleware that ensures that your user is authenticated no matter which page they visit, you configure `nuxt-auth` as follows:
```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@sidebase/nuxt-auth'],
  auth: {
    globalAppMiddleware: true
  }
})
```

That's it! Every page of your application will now need authentication for the user to visit it.

### Middleware Options

#### `unauthenticatedOnly`

Whether to only allow unauthenticated users to access this page. Authenticated users will be redirected to `/` or the route defined in `navigateAuthenticatedTo`

#### `navigateAuthenticatedTo`

Where to redirect authenticated users if `unauthenticatedOnly` is set to true

#### `navigateUnauthenticatedTo`

Where to redirect unauthenticated users if this page is protected

### Disabling the global middleware locally

To disable the global middleware on a specific page only, you can use the [`definePageMeta` macro](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/define-page-meta#definepagemeta) to turn `auth` off:
```vue
<!-- file: ~/pages/index.vue -->
<template>
  <div>I'm publicly available!</div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
definePageMeta({ auth: false })
</script>
```

Note: This only works on `pages/`. It notably does not work inside the `app.vue`.


## Local middleware

To protect specific pages with a middleware, you can use the [`definePageMeta` macro](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/define-page-meta#definepagemeta) to turn `auth` on:
```vue
<!-- file: ~/pages/unprotected.vue -->
<template>
  <div>I'm protected! Only logged in users will see me</div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
definePageMeta({ middleware: 'auth' })
</script>
```

Note: You cannot use local protection when you turned on the global middleware by setting `globalAppMiddleware: true` in the `nuxt-auth` configuration. You will get an error along the lines of "Error: Unknown route middleware: 'auth'". This is because the `auth` middleware is then added globally and not available to use as a local, page-specific middleware.

## Custom middleware

You may create your own application-side middleware in order to implement custom, more advanced authentication logic.

::alert{type="warning"}
Creating a custom middleware is an advanced, experimental option and may result in unexpected or undesired behavior if you are not familiar with advanced Nuxt 3 concepts.
::

To implement your custom middleware:
1. Create an application-side middleware that applies either globally or is named (see [the Nuxt docs for more](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/middleware#middleware-directory))
2. Add logic based on `useAuth` to it

When adding the logic, you need to watch out when calling other `async` composable functions. This can lead to `context`-problems in Nuxt, see [the explanation for this here](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/issues/5740#issuecomment-1229197529). In order to avoid these problems, you will need to either:
- use the undocumented `callWithNuxt` utility when `await`ing other composables,
- return an async function where possible instead of `await`ing it to avoid `callWithNuxt`

Following are examples of both kinds of usage:
::code-group
```ts [direct return]
// file: ~/middleware/authentication.global.ts
export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to) => {
  const { status, signIn } = useAuth()

  // Return immediately if user is already authenticated
  if (status.value === 'authenticated') {
    return
  }

  /**
   * We cannot directly call and/or return `signIn` here as `signIn` uses async composables under the hood, leading to "nuxt instance undefined errors", see https://github.com/nuxt/framework/issues/5740#issuecomment-1229197529
   *
   * So to avoid calling it, we return it immediately.
   */
  return signIn(undefined, { callbackUrl: to.path }) as ReturnType<typeof navigateTo>
})
```
```ts [callWithNuxt]
// file: ~/middleware/authentication.global.ts
import { useNuxtApp } from '#imports'
import { callWithNuxt } from '#app/nuxt'

export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to) => {
  // It's important to do this as early as possible
  const nuxtApp = useNuxtApp()

  const { status, signIn } = useAuth()

  // Return immediately if user is already authenticated
  if (status.value === 'authenticated') {
    return
  }

  /**
   * We cannot directly call and/or return `signIn` here as `signIn` uses async composables under the hood, leading to "nuxt instance undefined errors", see https://github.com/nuxt/framework/issues/5740#issuecomment-1229197529
   *
   * So to avoid calling it, we call it via `callWithNuxt`.
   */
  await callWithNuxt(nuxtApp, signIn, [undefined, { callbackUrl: to.path }])
})
```

## Guest Mode

Since v0.5.0 `nuxt-auth` also offers a guest mode. Checkout the [guest mode](/nuxt-auth/v0.6/application-side/guest-mode) documentation.
