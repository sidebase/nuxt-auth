# Guest Mode

::alert{type="success"}
This feature will be added in v0.5.0 of `nuxt-auth`.
::

You can use `nuxt-auth` to setup pages that are accessible only when the user is **not logged in**. This is sometimes called "guest mode". The behavior of such a page is as follows:
- A logged in user visits the page -> redirect to another (likely protected) page,
- A logged out user visits the page -> they are allowed to stay and view it

This behavior is useful for login pages that you don't want to be visitable by logged in users: Why should they go through a login flow again?

## Usage

Briefly summarized, you can enable guest mode on a page by passing the following configuration:
::code-group
```ts [Global middleware enabled]
definePageMeta({
  auth: {
    unauthenticatedOnly: true,
    navigateAuthenticatedTo: '/profile',
  },
})
```
```ts [Global middleware disabled]
definePageMeta({
  middleware: 'auth',
  auth: {
    unauthenticatedOnly: true,
    navigateAuthenticatedTo: '/profile',
  },
})
```
::

The above will:
- allow only guest (== users that are not logged in) to visit the page
- redirect everyone who is already logged in to `/profile`

Note: Setting `unauthenticatedOnly: false` above is equivalent to setting `auth: false` from the user-perspective, but requires some extra middleware-steps, so is a bit less efficient. Therefore it is recommended to always use `auth: false` instead.
