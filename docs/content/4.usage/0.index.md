# Application-side usage

This module allows you user-data access, signing in, signing out and more [via `useSession`](#session-access-and-manipulation). It also allows you to defined [middleware that protects pages](#middleware).

Application-side usage refers to any code like pages, components or composables that are part of the universal server- and client-side rendering of Nuxt, see more in the [glossary](/nuxt-auth/configuration).

## Session access and manipulation

The `useSession` composable is your main gateway to accessing and manipulating session-state and data. Here's the main methdos you can use:

```ts
const {
  status,
  data,
  getCsrfToken,
  getProviders,
  getSession,
  signIn,
  signOut,
} = await useSession({
  // Whether a session is required. If it is, a redirect to the signin page will happen if no active session exists
  required: true
})

// Session status, either `unauthenticated`, `loading`, `authenticated`, see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#signout
status.value

// Session data, either `undefined` (= authentication not attempted), `null` (= user unauthenticated), `loading` (= session loading in progress), see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#signout
data.value

// Get / Reload the current session from the server, pass `{ required: true }` to force a login if no session exists, see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#getsession
await getSession()

// Get the current CSRF token, usually you do not need this function, see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#signout
await getCsrfToken()

// Get the supported providers, e.g., to build your own login page, see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#getproviders
await getProviders()

// Trigger a sign in, see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#signin
await signIn()

// Trigger a sign in with a redirect afterwards, see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#signin
await signIn(undefined, { callbackUrl: '/protected' })

// Trigger a sign in via a specific authentication provider with a redirect afterwards, see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#signin
await signIn('github', { callbackUrl: '/protected' })

// Trigger a sign in with username and password already passed, e.g., from your own custom-made sign-in form
await singIn('credentials', { username: 'jsmith', password: 'hunter2' })

// Trigger a sign out, see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#signout
await signOut()

// Trigger a sign out and send the user to the sign out page afterwards
await signOut({ calbackUrl: '/signout' })
```

Session `data` has the following interface:
```ts
interface DefaultSession {
  user?: {
    name?: string | null;
    email?: string | null;
    image?: string | null;
  };
  expires: ISODateString;
}
```

Note that this is only set when the use is logged-in and when the provider used to login the user provides the fields.

### Redirects

You can also pass the `callbackUrl` option to both the `signIn` and the `signOut` method. This allows you to redirect a user to a certain pages, after they've completed the action. This can be useful when a user attempts to open a page (`/protected`) but has to go through external authentication (e.g., via their google account) first.

You can use it like:
```ts
await signIn({ callbackUrl: '/protected' })
```

to redirect the user to the protected page they wanted to access _after_ they've been authenticated.

You can do the same for signing out the user:
```ts
await signOut({ callbackUrl: '/protected' })
```

E.g., here to redirect the user away from the already loaded, protected, page after signout (else, you will have to handle the redirect yourself).

### Custom sign in page

To create your custom sign-in page you can use `signIn` to directly start a provider-flow once the user selected it, e.g., by clicking on a button on your custom sign-in page. Here is a very simple sign-in page that either directly starts a github-oauth sign in flow or directly signs in the user via the credentials flow:
```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <p>Sign In Options</p>
    <button @click="signIn('github')">Github</button>
    <!-- NOTE: Here we hard-coded username and password, on your own page this should probably be connected to two inputs for username + password -->
    <button @click="signIn('credentials', { username: 'test', password: 'hunter2' })">Username and Password</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
const { signIn } = await useSession({ required: false })
</script>
```

Note: In the above example `username` and `password` are hard-coded. In your own custom page, these two fields should probably come from inputs on your page.

If you want to create a custom sign-in page that dynamically offers sign-in options based on your configured providers, you can call `getProviders()` first and then iterate over the supported providers to generate your sign in page.

## Middleware

You can use this library to define application middleware. This library supports all of [Nuxt's supported middleware approaches](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/directory-structure/middleware#middleware-directory). In all methods shown below we make use of the `callbackUrl` parameter to give the best user experience: If the user is not authenticated, they are forced to login, but will be redirected to the same page they wanted to visit after they successfully logged in. Without a `callbackUrl` parameter, the user would be directed to the index page `/`.

### Global middleware

Create a global authentication middleware that ensures that your user is authenticated no matter which page they visit. Create a file in the `middleware` directory that has a `.global.ts` suffix.

It should look like this:

```ts
// file: ~/middleware/auth.global.ts
export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware(async (to) => {
  await useSession({ callbackUrl: to.path })
})
```

That's it! This middleware will fetch a session and if no active session exists for the current user redirect to the login screen. If you want to write custom redirect logic, you could alter the above code to only apply to specific routes.

Here is a global middleware that protects only the routes that start with `/secret/`:
```ts
// file: ~/middleware/auth.global.ts
export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware(async (to) => {
  if (to.path.startsWith('/secret/')) {
    await useSession({ callbackUrl: to.path })
  }
})
```

Example of a middleware that redirects to a custom login page:
```ts
// file: ~/middleware/auth.global.ts
export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware(async (to) => {
  // 1. Always allow access to the login page
  if (to.path === '/login') {
    return
  }

  // 2. Otherwise: Check status and redirect to login page
  const { status } = await useSession({ required: false })
  if (status.value !== 'authenticated') {
    navigateTo('/login')
  }
})
```

### Named middleware

Named middleware behave similar to [global middleware](#global-middleware) but are not automatically applied to any pages.

To use them, first create a middleware:
```ts
// file: ~/middleware/auth.ts
export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware(async (to) => {
  await useSession({ callbackUrl: to.path })
})
```

Then inside your pages use the middleware with `definePageMeta`:
```vue
<!-- file: ~/pages/protected.vue -->
<template>
  <div>I'm a secret!</div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
definePageMeta({
  middleware: ['auth']
})
</script>
```

Note: `definePageMeta` can only be used inside the `pages/` directory.

Nuxt now calls the `auth.ts` middleware on every visit to this page.

### Inline middleware

To define a named middleware, you need to use `definePageMeta` as described [in the nuxt docs](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/api/utils/define-page-meta/). Then you can just call `useSession` as in the other middleware. Here's an example that would protect just the page itself:
```vue
<!-- file: ~/pages/protected.vue -->
<template>
  <div>I'm a secret!</div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
definePageMeta({
  middleware: async () => {
    await useSession({ callbackUrl: '/protected' })
  }
})
</script>
```

Note: `definePageMeta` can only be used inside the `pages/` directory
