### NUXT_SECRET

 When deploying `nuxt-auth` to Vercel you cannot set a random string as your nuxt secret. You must use a 32-bit generated secret. You can use [this](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32) website to generate a custom secret.

### ORIGIN

In order to set the correct origin go into your Vercel project settings and navigate to the `Domains` tab. Once there you will all the assigned domains and their assigned environment (production, dev).

Copy the correct domain for every enviroment and assign the environment variables to match the correct environment. 

### Github_*

Assign your generated GitHub 0Auth application id and secret. When generating your 0Auth application set the homepage URL to your vercel domain and the callback url to:

https://YOUR_VERCEL_APP.vercel.com/api/auth/callback/github
