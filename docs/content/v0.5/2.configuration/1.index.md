# Overview

There's two places to configure `nuxt-auth`:
- [auth key in `nuxt.config.ts`](/nuxt-auth/configuration/nuxt-config): Configure the module itself, e.g., whether global page protection is enabled
- [NuxtAuthHandler](/nuxt-auth/configuration/nuxt-auth-handler): Configure the authentication behavior, e.g., what authentication providers to use

For development, using the [Quick Start configuration](/nuxt-auth/getting-started/quick-start) will already bring you quite far. For a production deployment, you will have to:
- set the `origin` by:
    1. exporting the `AUTH_ORIGIN`-environment variable _at runtime_ (higher precedence)
    2. setting the `origin`-key inside the `nuxt.config.ts` config _at build-time_ (lower precendence)
- set a secret inside the `NuxtAuthHandler` config

See the detailed possible configuration options on the next pages.
