# Module (nuxt.config.ts)

Use the `auth`-key inside the `nuxt.config.ts` to configure the `nuxt-auth` module itself. Here are the available configuration options and their default values:
```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@sidebase/nuxt-auth'],
  auth: {
    // The module is enabled. Change this to disable the module
    isEnabled: true,

    // The origin is set to the development origin. Change this when deploying to production by setting `origin` in this config before build-time or by exporting `AUTH_ORIGIN` by running `export AUTH_ORIGIN=...`
    origin: 'http://localhost:3000',

    // The base path to the authentication endpoints. Change this if you want to add your auth-endpoints at a non-default location
    basePath: '/api/auth',

    // Whether to periodically refresh the session. Change this to `true` for a refresh every seconds or set this to a number like `5000` for a refresh every 5000 milliseconds (aka: 5 seconds)
    enableSessionRefreshPeriodically: false,

    // Whether to refresh the session whenever a window focus event happens, i.e, when your user refocuses the window. Set this to `false` to turn this off
    enableSessionRefreshOnWindowFocus: true,

    // Whether to add a global authentication middleware that will protect all pages without exclusion
    globalAppMiddleware: false,

    // Select the default-provider to use when `signIn` is called. Setting this here will also effect the global middleware behavior: E.g., when you set it to `github` and the user is unauthorized, they will be directly forwarded to the Github OAuth page instead of seeing the app-login page
    defaultProvider: undefined,

    // Whether to automatically set the callback url to the page the user tried to visit when the middleware stopped them. This is useful to disable this when using the credentials provider, as it does not allow a `callbackUrl`. Setting this to a string-value will result in that being used as the callbackUrl path.
    addDefaultCallbackUrl: true,


    // Configuration of the global auth-middleware (only applies if you set `globalAppMiddleware: true` above!)
    globalMiddlewareOptions: {

        // Whether to allow access to 404 pages without authentication. Set this to `false` to force users to sign-in before seeing `404` pages. Setting this to false may lead to vue-router problems (as the target page does not exist)
        allow404WithoutAuth: true,

        // Whether to automatically set the callback url to the page the user tried to visit when the middleware stopped them. This is useful to disable this when using the credentials provider, as it does not allow a `callbackUrl`. Setting this to a string-value will result in that being used as the callbackUrl path. Note: You also need to set the global `addDefaultCallbackUrl` setting to `false` if you want to fully disable this for the global middleware.
        addDefaultCallbackUrl: true
    }
  }
})
```

The `origin` and the `basePath` together are equivalent to the [`NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable of NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#nextauth_url)

## origin

**You must set the `origin` in production!** You have two options to set it:
1. Set the `AUTH_ORIGIN` environment variable _at runtime_
2. Set the `origin` origin-config key inside the `nuxt.config.ts` (see an example above) _at build-time_

The `AUTH_ORIGIN` environment variable takes precendence over the `origin` configuration key, so you can always overwrite the origin at deploy-time.

The origin must be set so that `nuxt-auth` can ensure that callbacks for authentication are correct. The `origin` consists out of (up to) 3 parts:
- scheme: `http` or `https`
- host: e.g., `localhost`, `example.org`, `www.sidebase.io`
- port: e.g., `:3000`, `:4444`; leave empty to implicitly set `:80` for http, and `:443` for https (this is an internet convention, don't ask)

For the demo-app at https://nuxt-auth-example.sidebase.io we set the `origin` to `https://nuxt-auth-example.sidebase.io`. If for some reason required, you can explicitly set the `origin` to `http://localhost:3000` to stop `nuxt-auth` from aborting `npm run build` when the origin is unset.

## basePath

This is what tells the module where you added the authentication endpoints. Per default the `basePath` is set to `/api/auth`, so that means that the module expects that all requests to `/api/auth/*` will be handled by the `NuxtAuthHandler`.

To statify this, you need to create a [catch-all server-route](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/pages/#catch-all-route) at that location by creating a file `~/server/api/auth/[...].ts` that exports the `NuxtAuthHandler`, see more on this in the [Quick Start](/nuxt-auth/getting-started/quick-start) or in the [`NuxtAuthHandler` documentation](/nuxt-auth/configuration/nuxt-auth-handler)

If you want to have the authentication at another location, you can overwrite the `basePath`, e.g., when setting:
- `basePath: "/api/_auth"` -> add the authentication catch-all endpoints into `~/server/api/_auth/[...].ts`
- `basePath: "/_auth"` -> add the authentication catch-all endpoints into `~/server/routes/_auth/[...].ts`

See [Nuxt server-routes docs on catch-all routes for a further explanation.](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/server#server-routes)

## globalAppMiddleware

This is a middleware that comes included with `nuxt-auth`. When you enable it, it will protect _all_ pages, so even your index page (`/`) will not be accessible without a login anymore.
