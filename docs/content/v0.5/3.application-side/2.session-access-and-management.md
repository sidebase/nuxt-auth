# Session Access and Management
::alert{type="info"}
Prior to v0.5.0 `useAuth()` was called `useSession()`.
::

The `useAuth` composable is your main gateway to accessing and manipulating session-state and data. Here's the main methods you can use:

```ts
const {
  status,
  data,
  lastRefreshedAt,
  getCsrfToken,
  getProviders,
  getSession,
  signIn,
  signOut,
} = useAuth()

// Session status, either `unauthenticated`, `loading`, `authenticated`, see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#signout
status.value

// Session data, either `undefined` (= authentication not attempted), `null` (= user unauthenticated), `loading` (= session loading in progress), see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#signout
data.value

// Time at which the session was last refreshed, either `undefined` if no refresh was attempted or a `Date`-object of the time the refresh happened
lastRefreshedAt.value

// Get / Reload the current session from the server, pass `{ required: true }` to force a login if no session exists, see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#getsession
await getSession()

// Get the current CSRF token, usually you do not need this function, see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#signout
await getCsrfToken()

// Get the supported providers, e.g., to build your own login page, see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#getproviders
await getProviders()

// Trigger a sign-in, see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#signin
await signIn()

// Trigger a sign-in with a redirect afterwards, see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#signin
await signIn(undefined, { callbackUrl: '/protected' })

// Trigger a sign-in via a specific authentication provider with a redirect afterwards, see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#signin
await signIn('github', { callbackUrl: '/protected' })

// Trigger a sign-in with username and password already passed, e.g., from your own custom-made sign-in form
await signIn('credentials', { username: 'jsmith', password: 'hunter2' })

// Trigger a sign-out, see https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#signout
await signOut()

// Trigger a sign-out and send the user to the sign-out page afterwards
await signOut({ callbackUrl: '/signout' })
```

Session `data.value` has the following interface:
```ts
interface DefaultSession {
  user?: {
    name?: string | null;
    email?: string | null;
    image?: string | null;
  };
  expires: ISODateString;
}
```

Note that this is only set when the use is logged-in and when the provider used to login the user provides the fields.

## Redirects

You can also pass the `callbackUrl` option to both the `signIn`, the `signOut` and the `getSession` method. This allows you to redirect a user to a certain pages, after they've completed the action. This can be useful when a user attempts to open a page (`/protected`) but has to go through external authentication (e.g., via their google account) first.

You can use it like:
```ts
await signIn({ callbackUrl: '/protected' })
```

to redirect the user to the protected page they wanted to access _after_ they've been authenticated.

You can do the same for signing out the user:
```ts
await signOut({ callbackUrl: '/protected' })
```

E.g., to redirect the user away from the already loaded, protected, page after signout (else, you will have to handle the redirect yourself).

You may also pass specify a callback for the `getSession` utility:
```ts
await getSession({ callbackUrl: '/protected' })
```
