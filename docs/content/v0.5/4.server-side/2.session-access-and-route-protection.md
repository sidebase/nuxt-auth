# Session Access and Route Protection

On the server side you can get access to the current session like this:
```ts
import { getServerSession } from '#auth'

export default eventHandler(async (event) => {
  const session = await getServerSession(event)
})
```

This is inspired by [the `getServerSession`](https://next-auth.js.org/tutorials/securing-pages-and-api-routes#securing-api-routes) of NextAuth.js. It also avoids an external, internet call to the `GET /api/auth/sessions` endpoint, instead directly calling a pure JS-method.

Note: If you use [Nuxts' `useFetch`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-fetch) from your app-components to fetch data from an endpoint that uses `getServerSession` or [`getToken`](/nuxt-auth/server-side/jwt-access) you will need to manually pass along cookies as [Nuxt 3 universal rendering](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/rendering#universal-rendering) will not do this per-default when it runs on the server-side. Not passing along cookies will result in `getServerSession` returning `null` when it is called from the server-side as no auth-cookies will exist. Here's an example that manually passes along cookies:
```ts
const headers = useRequestHeaders(['cookie']) as HeadersInit
const { data: token } = await useFetch('/api/token', { headers })
```

## Endpoint Protection

To protect an endpoint, check the session after fetching it:
```ts
// file: ~/server/api/protected.get.ts
import { getServerSession } from '#auth'

export default eventHandler(async (event) => {
  const session = await getServerSession(event)
  if (!session) {
    return { status: 'unauthenticated!' }
  }
  return { status: 'authenticated!' }
})

```

## Server Middleware

You can also use this in a [Nuxt server middleware](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/server#server-middleware) to protect multiple pages at once and keep the authentication logic out of your endpoints:
```ts
// file: ~/server/middleware/auth.ts
import { getServerSession } from '#auth'

export default eventHandler(async (event) => {
  const session = await getServerSession(event)
  if (!session) {
    throw createError({ statusMessage: 'Unauthenticated', statusCode: 403 })
  }
})
```
