# Introduction

::alert{type="info"}
These are the docs for the experimental v0.6 version of `nuxt-auth` with static Nuxt 3 and `local` provider support. [Checkout the `0.5`-docs](/nuxt-auth/getting-started) for the nuxt-auth-version <=0.5.
::

`nuxt-auth` is an open source Nuxt module that provides authentication for Nuxt 3 applications.

`nuxt-auth` supports the following:
::list{type="success"}
- `useAuth` composable to perform authentication-related actions from the application
- global- and local-application middleware to protect application-pages
- guest-mode to only allows guest to see certain pages (e.g.: the login page)
- authentication-backend setup for the `authjs`-auth-provider
- static Nuxt 3 apps with the `local`-auth-provider
- documentation, recipes and example code to get you started
::

`nuxt-auth` employs 2 providers to facilitate the act of authenticating a user:
::list{type="success"}
- `local`: Username and password authentication. `local` expects the endpoint to return a token that can be used to authenticate subsequent requests
- `authjs`: A `authjs` (`next-auth`) based provider that supports most OAuth- and Magic-URL sign-ins (think Slack or Notion). This provider also supports username and password based sign-in, but discourages from using it
::

Other libraries / modules would call these authentication-schemes, backends or maybe even strategys.

## Which Provider should I pick?

To pick a provider you will first have to take into consideration the requirements of your use-case. Below is a small table to help you pick:

|                                                           	|                               authjs 	| local 	|
|-----------------------------------------------------------	|-------------------------------------:	|------:	|
| **Authentication Methods**                                	|                                      	|       	|
| OAuth                                                     	|                    ✅ (>50 providers) 	|     ❌ 	|
| Magic URLs                                                	|                                    ✅ 	|     ❌ 	|
| Credential / Username + Password flow                     	| 🚧 (if possible: use `local` instead) 	|     ✅ 	|
|                                                           	|                                      	|       	|
| **Features**                                              	|                                      	|       	|
| app `useAuth`-composable to sign-in, sign-out, ...        	|                                    ✅ 	|     ✅ 	|
| session-management: auto-refresh, refresh on refocus, ... 	| ✅                                    	| ✅     	|
| static apps ("nuxi generate")                             	| ❌                                    	| ✅     	|
| guest mode                                                	| ✅                                    	| ✅     	|
| app-side middleware                                       	| ✅                                    	| ✅     	|
| server-side middleware                                    	| ✅                                    	| ✅     	|
| pre-made login-page                                       	| ✅ (impacts bundle-size)              	| ❌     	|
| database-adapters, server-side callback-hooks             	| ✅                                    	| ❌     	|

In general one can say that picking:
- `authjs` is best suited for plug-and-play OAuth for established oauth-providers or magic-url based sign-ins
- `local` is best when you already have a backend that accepts username + password as a login or want to build a static application

### `authjs` Remarks

The `authjs` provider is able to provide all of its features by wrapping [Auth.js / NextAuth.js](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth) under the hood. This gives the reliability & convenience of a >12.000 github star library to the Nuxt 3 ecosystem with a native nuxt developer experience (DX). Wrapping `Auth.js / NextAuth.js` has the second advantage that many OAuth providers, database adapters, callbacks and more are supported out-of-the-box. This also means that you can use all NextAuth.js and Auth.js guides and documentation to achieve things with the `authjs` provider of `nuxt-auth`.

`nuxt-auth` also provides Nuxt 3 specific features like a convenient application-side composable to login, logout, access user-authentication data or an authentication middleware and plugin that take care of managing the user authentication lifecycle by fetching authentication data on initial load, refreshing the user authentication on re-focusing the tab and more.

In the future a separate OAuth provider for static apps may be added, read the next section for more on this.

#### Auth.js vs next-auth

We use `authjs` everywhere to mean `authjs` and `next-auth` interchangably as `next-auth` is currently transitioning to become `authjs` (branded name: `Auth.js`), see [the announcement here](https://twitter.com/balazsorban44/status/1603082914362986496).

We are following this transition and are changing code related to this as it becomes stable enough to use it. You can follow our implementation of this transition [in this issue](https://github.com/sidebase/nuxt-auth/v0.6/issues/117). If you are googling anything related to this provider, we recommend that you still use the term `next-auth` as this is still the mainly used library and the stable one we mostly use under the hood. New features that are `Auth.js` only are _not_ guaranteed to work at the moment, as we still mostly rely on next-auth as a stable foundation.

### `local` Remarks

The `local` provider is based on [the local schema of the Nuxt 2 nuxt-auth module](https://auth.nuxtjs.org/schemes/local). It was added in v0.6.0 of `nuxt-auth` and serves as a starting point to add further static providers like [cookie based](https://auth.nuxtjs.org/schemes/cookie) authentication, support for [refresh tokens](https://auth.nuxtjs.org/schemes/refresh) and [static OAuth support](https://auth.nuxtjs.org/schemes/oauth2).

The `local` provider works by receiving an authentication token from the backend it send a `username` and `password` to. This could for example be a JWT token. The `local` provider then stores this token and makes it accessible to you for use. The `local` provider will also fetch user / session information from the backend once it has successfully logged in.

Any help with this effort is very welcome! Feel free to open an issue or a PR to add support for further providers 💘.

## Starting with sidebase

The easiest way to get started with `nuxt-auth` is using [the sidebase Merino stack](/sidebase):
::code-group
```bash [npm]
npm create sidebase@latest
```
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm create sidebase@latest
```
```bash [yarn]
# Note: Due to a known problem with `yarn`, it is not possible to force yarn to always use `@latest`: https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/6587
yarn create sidebase
```
::
This will create a Nuxt 3 project with `nuxt-auth` already setup & working.
