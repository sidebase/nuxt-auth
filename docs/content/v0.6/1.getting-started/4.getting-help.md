# Getting Help

At some point, you may find that there's an issue you need some help with.

But don't worry! We're a friendly community of developers and we'd love to help. Concretely this means to:
- Checkout the docs (page that you are currently viewing),
- Search open & resolved issues and discussions: https://github.com/sidebase/nuxt-auth/v0.6/issues
- Hop on Discord to ask us directly: https://discord.gg/VzABbVsqAc,
- Open an issue to file a bug, ask for an enhancement or get an answer to a question: https://github.com/sidebase/nuxt-auth/v0.6/issues/new/choose

We aim to follow the getting-help standards of the nuxt-project as described here and ask you to do the same when opening an issue or pinging us for help: https://nuxt.com/docs/community/getting-help#getting-help.

## Minimal Reproductions

When resolving a bug a minimal reproduction is almost always required, [read on the official nuxt.com page how to create one](https://nuxt.com/docs/community/reporting-bugs#create-a-minimal-reproduction).

Note that your reproduction should also work outside of providers like stackblitz. The reason for this is that stackblitz (and likely other, similar providers) do not properly support cookies, which are essential for `nuxt-auth` to work.
