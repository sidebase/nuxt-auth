# Overview

The following pages contain some recipes for commonly asked patterns, questions and implementations. The recipes are mostly provided by the community and can serve as guidelines to implement something similar in your Nuxt 3 application. The recipes are not all tested through by the sidebase team. If you have any concerns, questions or improvement proposals or want to contribute a recipe yourself, we'd be very happy if you open an issue on our repository: https://github.com/sidebase/nuxt-auth/v0.6/issues/new/choose

Thanks to everybody who contributed so far ❤️
