# Which Provider should I pick?

To pick a provider you will first have to take into consideration the requirements of your use-case. In general one can say that picking:

- `authjs` is best suited for plug-and-play OAuth for established oauth-providers or magic-url based sign-ins
- `local` is best when you already have a backend that accepts username + password as a login or want to build a static application
- `refresh` if you would need to extend the functionality of the `local` provider, with a refresh token

If you are still unsure, below are some tables to help you pick:
