# Which Provider should I pick?

To pick a provider you will first have to take into consideration the requirements of your use-case. In general one can say that picking:

- `authjs` is best suited for plug-and-play OAuth for established oauth-providers or magic-url based sign-ins.
- `local` is best when you already have a backend that accepts username + password as a login or want to build a static application. The Local Provider also supports refresh tokens since `v0.9.0`.

:::warning Breaking change
In `v0.9.0` the `refresh` provider was integrated into the `local` provider. Read the [upgrade guide](/upgrade/version-0.9.0).

If you are still unsure, below are some tables to help you pick:
