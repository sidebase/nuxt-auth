# Adding your recipes

We appreciate anyone willing to share their recipes with the community! Authentication is a complex requirement, individual to every project, therefore the more experiences the community shares with one another the better!

We are willing to add recipes that come in different media forms. These could be:

- A blog post
- A step-by-step guide
- A GitHub repository
- _Any other media you prefer!_

However, we have noticed that the more detailed a recipe is the more helpful it can be to the community!

## Submitting your recipe

If you would like to submit a recipe, please open a Pull request, with your recipe added to `~/docs/recipes/community`.
