## Breaking Changes

### Renaming of default middleware

In 0.10.0 we renamed the included middleware from `auth` to `sidebase-auth`. This is a quality of life change to allow developers to create their own custom middleware named `auth.global.ts` without conflicting with the provided middleware.

If you use the auth middleware inline on any of your pages you will need to rename it:

```vue diff
<script lang="ts" setup>
definePageMeta({
  middleware: 'auth', // [!code --]
  middleware: 'sidebase-auth', // [!code ++]
})
</script>

<template>
  Only I am protected!
</template>
```

### Adjustments to the computation of `baseURL` and `AUTH_ORIGIN`

In 0.10.0 we spent a considerable amount of time reworking how `@sidebase/nuxt-auth` determines which endpoints to make requests to. If you would like to view the full PR and discussion, you can find it [here](https://github.com/sidebase/nuxt-auth/pull/913).

Read more [in a dedicated guide](../guide/advanced/url-resolutions.md).

Below are some notable changes.

#### URLs are now joined

`baseURL` now means exactly that, it will be prepended to a path before making a call. That means you need to adjust your config accordingly:

```ts diff
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  auth: {
    baseURL: 'https://example.com', // [!code --]
    baseURL: 'https://example.com/api/auth', // [!code ++]

    provider: {
      type: 'local',
      endpoints: {
        signIn: { path: '/login', method: 'post' },
      }
    }
  }
})
```

#### Adjustments when using an external backend for the `local`-provider

In previous versions of `@sidebase/nuxt-auth` a very specific setup was needed to ensure that external backends could properly be used for the `local` provider. In 0.10.0 we reworked the internal handling or URLs to make it more consistent across providers and configurations.

If you were previously using an external backend, you can now prefix endpoint paths with a `/`:

```ts diff
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  auth: {
    provider: {
      type: 'local',
      endpoints: {
        signIn: { path: 'login', method: 'post' }, // [!code --]
        signIn: { path: '/login', method: 'post' }, // [!code ++]
        getSession: { path: 'session', method: 'get' }, // [!code --]
        getSession: { path: '/session', method: 'get' }, // [!code ++]
      }
    }
  }
})
```

---

Therefore as of version 0.10.0, we recommend the following setup to set your `AUTH_ORIGIN` or `baseURL`:

::: code-group

```ts diff [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // ... other configuration
  auth: {
    baseUrl: 'https://my-backend.com/api/auth', // [!code --]
    // This is technically not needed as it is the default, but it's here for illustrative purposes
    originEnvKey: 'AUTH_ORIGIN', // [!code ++]
  }
})
```

```env diff [.env]
AUTH_ORIGIN="https://my-backend.com/api/auth" // [!code ++]
```
