## Breaking Changes

- `auth.session` renamed to `auth.sessionRefresh`

```ts
// nuxt.config.ts

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@sidebase/nuxt-auth'],
  auth: {
    session: { // [!code --]
      enableRefreshOnWindowFocus: true, // [!code --]
      enableRefreshPeriodically: 10000, // [!code --]
    }, // [!code --]
    sessionRefresh: { // [!code ++]
      enableOnWindowFocus: true, // [!code ++]
      enablePeriodically: 10000, // [!code ++]
    }, // [!code ++]
  }
})
```

## RefreshHandler

In [#715](https://github.com/sidebase/nuxt-auth/pull/715), we took the first step to improve the behavior and possibilities to customize the Refresh behaviour of your application. In [#766](https://github.com/sidebase/nuxt-auth/pull/766) we finalized these changes and improved the previous configuration options. You can define the location of a custom RefreshHandler inside your Nuxt config under `auth.sessionRefresh.refreshHandler`.

To customize the session refreshing you can provide a refresh handler. A custom `RefreshHandler` requires an `init`- and a `destroy`-function.

- `init` will be called when the nuxt application is mounted. Here you may add event listeners and initialize custom refresh behaviour. The method will receive a `RefreshHandlerConfig`. The type consists of `enablePeriodically` & `enableOnWindowFocus`.
- `destroy` will be called when your app is unmounted. Here you may run your clean up routine e.g. to remove your event listeners.

```ts
import type { RefreshHandler } from '@sidebase/nuxt-auth'

// You may also use a plain object with `satisfies RefreshHandler`, of course!
class CustomRefreshHandler implements RefreshHandler {
  init(): void {
    console.info('Use the full power of classes to customize refreshHandler!')
  }

  destroy(): void {
    console.info(
      'Hover above class properties or go to their definition '
      + 'to learn more about how to craft a refreshHandler'
    )
  }
}

export default new CustomRefreshHandler()
```
