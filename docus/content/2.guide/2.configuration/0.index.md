# Glossary

The nuxt-auth module takes care of authentication and sessions.
There are some terms we use in this documentation that may not immediately be known to every reader. Here is an explanation for some of them:

##### 🔑 authentication
The process of ensuring that somebody is who they claims to be, e.g., via a username and password or by trusting an external authority (e.g., oauth via google, amazon, ...)

##### 👤 sessions
Persist the information that you have been authenticated for some duration across different requests. Additional data can be attached to a session, e.g., a username. (Note: If you need only sessions but no authentication, you can check-out nuxt-session)

##### 💻 application / application-side / universal-application
This references all Nuxt code of your app that is universally rendered. In short this means that that code is rendered on the server-side and on the client-side, so all JS in it is executed twice. This is an important distinction, as some things may behave different on the server-side than on the client-side. We use application... to denote something that will be universally rendered

##### 💾 server / server-side
This references all Nuxt code of your app that will run only on your server. For example, all code inside the ~/server directory should only ever run on the server
